<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    - make collide lines transparent(after testing) // can just comment out drawLines() call in function main()//oh wait that's smart
    -sound effects 
    -instructions in first level
    -circle around end point
    -make the end page
    -add transition animation and find realistic spots for transitions
    -get x offset to start in the right place (i believe requires getting the image to start at 0?)
    -weird outline thing around the play button
    -space between buttons when paused 
    -pause and play buttons not on second level
    -instructions page
    -new level pages/ level transitions to go with them
