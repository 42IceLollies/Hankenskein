<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    - make collide lines transparent(after testing) // can just comment out drawLines() call in function main()
    - save position every few seconds so they can come back to the area in the level that they were at
    - just general saving of level system - window.onUnload save everything
    - provide a couple different colors for hank if time?
    -sound effects 
    -add pink back to the color select so they can change back to pink
    -instructions in first level
    -circle around end point
    -make the end page
    -add pause and play at top of level, home and settings comes up if you pause and game grays out
    -add transition animation and find realistic spots for transitions

    for save object, I'm thinking of having music settings, level, offset position in level, color (if it gets implemented),
    idk what else we need for this
