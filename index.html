<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    - make collide lines transparent(after testing) // can just comment out drawLines() call in function main()//oh wait that's smart
    -sound effects 
    -circle around end point
    -add transition animation and find realistic spots for transitions
    -get x offset to start in the right place (i believe requires getting the image to start at 0?)
    -weird outline thing around the play button
    -instructions page
    -make transitions smoother - like last thing to do but still
    -instructions button
    -play button bug
    -fix yarn colors
    -make sure music plays on all pages
    -fix dish cabinet
    -add lines to new levels
    -ending of level 2
    -better way to move from end to home Page?
    -change instructions page to hideable div like settings
    -toggle instructions and settings instead of just turinging them on and off
