<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    - make collide lines transparent(after testing) // can just comment out drawLines() call in function main()
    - provide a couple different colors for hank if time?
    -sound effects 
    -add pink back to the color select so they can change back to pink
    -instructions in first level
    -circle around end point
    -make the end page
    -add pause and play at top of level, home and settings comes up if you pause and game grays out
    -add transition animation and find realistic spots for transitions
    -comics in between
    -get x offset to start in the right place (i believe requires getting the image to start at 0?)
