<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    -sound effects  - maybe one for collision with high velocity, door opening as leaves level or sparkling sound when hits the yellow circle, whoosh for lasso launch, click when player clicks screen - just ideas idk
    -could do with another read through of points that are too close together
    -goes from end level to level two- i think its because the level is set to one when you visit non level pages aside from main menu
    -Align ending circles
    -make it so you can't get out sides of sink or bathtub
    -sticks in ground after jumping out of bathtub
    -side of toilet is sticky
    -make lasso easier to aim
    -put line along top of stove
    -goes through pan
    -goes through thingy above stove
    -make either sink or bathtub lines straight
    -level three music instructions not hidings
    -get ryan to send to ftp

    things to do after competition:
      -add transition animation and find realistic spots for transitions
