<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    - make collide lines transparent(after testing)
    - save position every few seconds so they can come back to the area in the level that they were at
    - just general saving of level system
    - transition between levels
    - home and settings button always present
    - provide a couple different colors for hank if time?
    -make cursor hand when over settings
