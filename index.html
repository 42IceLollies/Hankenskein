<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    -sound effects  - maybe one for collision with high velocity, door opening as leaves level or sparkling sound when hits the yellow circle, whoosh for lasso launch, click when player clicks screen - just ideas idk
    -could do with another read through of points that are too close together
    -play a couple more times to see if it jumps around weirdly again
    -Align ending circles

    things to do after competition:
      -add transition animation and find realistic spots for transitions
      -get image to start at set xOffset point
