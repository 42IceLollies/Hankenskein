<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    - make collide lines transparent(after testing) // can just comment out drawLines() call in function main()
    - save position every few seconds so they can come back to the area in the level that they were at
    - just general saving of level system 
    - transition between levels
    - home and settings button always present
    - provide a couple different colors for hank if time?
    -make cursor hand when over settings
    -sound effects
    -still need to center stuff in settings
    -implement actual music as well
    -add pink back to the color select so they can change back to pink

    for save object, I'm thinking of having music settings, level, offset position in level, color (if it gets implemented),
    idk what else we need for this
