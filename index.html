<!-- List of little things to do before competition so I don't forget
    - make collide lines transparent(after testing) // can just comment out drawLines() call in function main()
    - save position every few seconds so they can come back to the area in the level that they were at
    - just general saving of level system 
    - transition between levels
    - provide a couple different colors for hank if time?
    -make cursor hand when over settings - and other things that it doesn't work on
    -sound effects 
    -implement actual music as well
    -add pink back to the color select so they can change back to pink
    -instructions in first level
    -circle around end point
    -make the end page

    for save object, I'm thinking of having music settings, level, offset position in level, color (if it gets implemented),
    idk what else we need for this
